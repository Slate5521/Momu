        <description>Outdoors expresses the need not to be cooped up inside. It is harmed by long periods inside, especially underground. It improves when someone spends time under the sky, especially outdoors. It's not about the size of the rooms, but the need to be outside from time to time. Lack of outdoors time is a significant challenge for people who dwell in underground bases.</description>
